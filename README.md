Dependencies:
 * Python **3.5**
 * Numpy version **1.14.5**
 * TensorFlow version **1.10.5**
 * MuJoCo version **1.50** and mujoco-py **1.50.1.56**
 * OpenAI Gym version **0.10.5**

Once Python **3.5** is installed, you can install the remaining dependencies using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.

**Note**: MuJoCo versions until 1.5 do not support NVMe disks therefore won't be compatible with recent Mac machines.
There is a request for OpenAI to support it that can be followed [here](https://github.com/openai/gym/issues/638).

In `experts/`, the provided expert policies are:
* Ant-v2.pkl
* HalfCheetah-v2.pkl
* Hopper-v2.pkl
* Humanoid-v2.pkl
* Reacher-v2.pkl
* Walker2d-v2.pkl

The name of the pickle file corresponds to the name of the gym environment.
